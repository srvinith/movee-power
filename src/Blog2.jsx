              Comparing costs and climate impacts of various electric vehicle charging systems across the United States
            </h3>
            <p>
              <b> Abstract</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The seamless adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States necessitates the development of extensive and effective charging infrastructure. Various charging systems have been proposed, including Direct Current Fast Charging, Battery Swapping, and Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer. While many studies have evaluated the charging costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of EVs, a comprehensive analysis comparing these systems and their implications across vehicle categories remains unexplored. This study compares the total cost of ownership (TCO) and GHG-intensity of EVs using these charging systems. Based on nationwide infrastructure deployment simulations, the change to TCO from adopting EVs varies by scenario, vehicle category, and location, with local fuel prices, electricity prices, and traffic volumes dramatically impacting results. Further, EV GHG-intensity depends on local electricity mixes and infrastructure utilizations. This research highlights the responsiveness of EV benefits resulting from technology advancements, deployment decisions, and policymaking.

              <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
              
              <p>The United States (U.S.) is currently undertaking an ambitious initiative to deploy public charging infrastructure to facilitate the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessary for achieving climate targets1. As EVs continue to gain popularity in all vehicle classes, ensuring uninterrupted transportation has become a critical objective for policymakers and stakeholders1,2. While initial efforts have focused on deploying Level 2 and Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) infrastructure3, a significant challenge lies in the charging time required to replenish EV batteries2. Long charging times pose potential inconveniences for EV drivers, particularly those embarking on long journeys or requiring urgent charging2. Addressing this issue necessitates the implementation of charging systems capable of fulfilling consumer needs2,4. The electrification of medium-duty vehicles (MDVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs)4 changes the infrastructure needs to accommodate a broader range of vehicles beyond passenger cars and light-duty trucks (LDTs)5. Consequently, it is imperative to transition towards technologies that enable short dwell times for all vehicle types, such as 350-kilowatt (kW) DCFC, Battery Swapping (BSS), or Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT)5.

                Each of these technologies presents a distinct set of benefits and challenges. DCFC follows a similar model to traditional liquid refueling and allows for scalability by increasing the number of stations according to demand. However, the intermittent high-power loads of DCFC present challenges to the electrical grid and costs to the consumer6. In contrast, BSS optimizes grid loads by charging batteries before they are swapped, but their successful implementation relies on battery standardization and addressing social challenges related to battery ownership5,7. In addition, BSS requires two different sizes: a small size for cars and LDTs and a large size for MDVs and HDVs8. Despite these challenges, BSS offers reduced dwell times compared to DCFC, making their dwell time comparable to that of internal combustion engine (ICEV) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles9,10. Alternatively, DWPT inductively charges vehicles while they are in motion using embedded electronics in the roadway, effectively enabling smaller batteries and eliminating the need for vehicles to stop between destinations for recharging11. DWPT, however, may cause traffic disruptions during roadway replacements, has limited deployment history, and is capital intensive12,13. Despite the well-understood performance of these technologies, there remains a meaningful gap in understanding the economic and environmental implications that would arise from their widescale deployment.

                Current research on the economic and environmental impacts of EV charging systems is often narrowly focused, circumscribed by location, implementation scale, analysis scope, and scenario range. For instance, Wood et al. (2017) concentrated on the deployment of charging stations for varying levels of EV adoption without considering costs or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions14. Muratori et al. (2019) examined variations in electricity costs for DCFC, finding utilization rates and locations meaningfully affect electricity costs but did not account for total charging costs with the exclusion of capital and operational expenses15. Mulrow and Grubert (2023) investigated the GHG emissions linked with traditional EV infrastructure, including DCFC, finding the embodied emissions of such infrastructure to be minimal16.

                Conversely, the environmental impact of infrastructure emissions from DWPT and BSS remains unclear. Marmiroli et al. (2019) evaluated the GHG-intensity of DWPT infrastructure per distance, omitting an evaluation based on energy consumption17. Similarly, Limb et al. (2018) simulated the deployment of DWPT, analyzing charging costs and electricity emissions without considering the total cost of ownership (TCO) or lifecycle emissions11. While BSS has been identified as potentially economically viable18, its broader economic and environmental assessments are lacking. In summary, although there exists a body of literature that partially addresses the costs and GHG emissions associated with EV charging systems, there has yet to be a comprehensive study that evaluates these aspects holistically, compares the three charging technologies of BSS, DCFC, and DWPT, or considers their implications across different vehicle categories.</p>
