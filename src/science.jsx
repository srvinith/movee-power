    An in-depth analysis of electric vehicle charging station infrastructure, policy implications, and future trends
    </h3>
    <p>
       <b> Abstract</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    A significant transformation occurs globally as transportation switches from fossil fuel-powered to zero and ultra-low tailpipe emissions vehicles. The transition to the electric vehicle requires an infrastructure of charging stations (CSs) with information technology, ingenious, distributed energy generation units, and favorable government policies. This paper discusses the key factors when planning electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This paper provides information about planning and technological developments that can be used to improve the design and implementation of charging station infrastructure. A comprehensive review of the current electric vehicle scenario, the impact of EVs on grid integration, and Electric Vehicle optimal allocation provisioning are presented. In particular, this paper analyzes research and developments related to charging station infrastructure, challenges, and efforts to standardize the infrastructure to enhance future research work. In addition, the optimal placement of rapid charging stations is based on economic benefits and grid impacts. It also describes the challenges of adoption. On the other hand, future trends in the field, such as energy procurement from renewable sources and cars’ benefits to grid technology, are also presented and discussed.

        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>The escalation in need for conventional energy sources has caused multiple outcomes that negatively affect the environment. Resources are depleted, and CO2 is released in high amounts, causing the greenhouse effect and undesirable global warming (Wang and Cheng, 2020). As a result of the Paris Agreement, CO2 emissions were reduced, and the planet’s temperature was controlled (Saerbeck et al., 2020). Clean energy resources and related technologies have been developed to mitigate these problems. Although technological advancements have significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, about one-quarter of these emissions come from the sector (Napoli et al., 2019). According to Outlook (2010), the growing population and freight movements will contribute to a 77% increase in transportation by 2055. Due to the above reasons, research and adoption of electric vehicles (EV) deserve exorbitant attention. By emitting very low or no tailpipe emissions and making very little noise, electric vehicles significantly reduce traffic congestion and contribute to a healthier living environment (Sanchez-Sutil et al., 2015, Abid et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2022, Chakir et al., 2022, Lan et al., 2022, Soares et al., 2022, Guo and Zhao, 2015). As a result of this transition to zero-emission vehicles, the automotive industry is switching to zero-emission vehicles (Bräunl et al., 2020, Domínguez-Navarro et al., 2019). Approximately 1.5 million new battery electric vehicles (BEV) have been added to the global fleet of BEVs (Martins et al., 2021) in 2019, with approximately 4.8 million BEVs in use globally.
        At their optimal locations, electric vehicle charging stations are essential to provide cheap and clean electricity produced by the grid and renewable energy resources, speeding up the adoption of electric vehicles (Alhazmi et al., 2017, Sathaye and Kelley, 2013). Establishing a suitable charging station network will help alleviate owners’ anxiety around electric vehicles, allowing the EVs to compete with internal combustion engines in terms of performance (Clemente et al., 2014). The market share of electric vehicles must be raised to emphasize continuous improvements in recharging technology. The current challenge with adopting electric vehicles is the “chicken or the egg” theory (Greene et al., 2020). A proper charging infrastructure that guarantees successful trip completion with no or minimal charging time delays is eagerly anticipated by consumers. Therefore, investors are waiting for enough electric vehicles to be on the road to make the charging infrastructure business profitable. Stakeholders disagree on whether fast-charging or smart charging is more appropriate for EV charging stations. The government’s policies also play an essential role in resolving these issues (Wolbertus et al., 2020). The lack of reasonably priced batteries that can store enough energy over a more extended period of time to improve the range of EVs is another essential factor affecting EV adoption (Benysek and Jarnut, 2012, Nie and Ghamami, 2013, Ghosh, 2020).</p>
